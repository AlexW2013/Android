This application is a personal project I created to gain more experience with Java and Android development as a whole.

About: An android app that functions as a retirement funds calculator based on multiple factors, such as growth rates and contributions

- Input funds for 401k, Stocks/funds, and other investments along with contribution/growth/income factors and how many years until retirement
- Calculates final dollar value for each fund, along with a combined total value of all funds
