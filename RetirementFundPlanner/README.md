A simple android app that functions as a retirement funds calculator
- Input funds for 401k, Stocks/funds, and other investments
- Calculates final value for each, and a combined total value

The app will be improved and worked on little by little. Possible future additions of past financial history, such as historic sp500 returns, and graphs that show overall fund growth.
